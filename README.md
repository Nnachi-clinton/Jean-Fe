# React + Vite

Run yarn on your machine to install the needed dependencies used.

Also, before runing the frontend, make sure the backend is running on https://localhost:7047/, while the frontend is running on http://localhost:5173/ else it won't communicate with the backend due to the strcit cors settings.

to start the server:

run yarn dev.

thank you.
